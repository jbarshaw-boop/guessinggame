# The Guessing Game Project

This make file creates a script (./guessinggame.sh), a command-line bash script that asks you how many files are in the CWD. It will continue running until you guess the number correctly (or exit with Ctrl + c). Not to  worry though, it will tell you if the guess was too high or too low.
This game will count hidden (dot) files as well as standard files, but not directories.


### Installation:
To install this bad boy, just grab the Makefile, throw it in any old directory, navigate to that directory, and run
`make`

**Since this is a bash (.sh) script, it will only work on Unix-like machines**


The make file was run on 2020-09-16 at 16:29
The guessinggame.sh script has 23 lines
